# Sales Forecasting Project Report

## Introduction

This report outlines the phases and priorities for developing a sales forecasting project. The goal is to predict future sales based on historical data and other relevant factors, ensuring a structured approach to project development and maintenance.

## Phase 1: Initial Setup & Data Exploration (High Priority)

### Purpose
Set up the environment, load data, and explore it.

### Tasks
1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Created `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` to manage package dependencies.
   - Initialized `README.md` to provide an overview of the project.
   - Added `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files from version control.

2. **Data Exploration**:
   - Developed `notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb` to load and analyze raw data.
   - Created `data/raw/` directory and placed sample datasets there.

### Outcome
A well-documented setup that allows team members to quickly onboard and start exploring the data.

## Phase 2: Data Preprocessing & Configuration

### Purpose
Clean and process data for training.

### Tasks
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Created `scripts/data_processing.py` to handle data cleaning and transformation.
   - Developed `notebooks/02_data_preprocessing.ipynb` to test and validate preprocessing steps.

2. **Data Storage**:
   - Stored processed data in `data/processed/` directory.

3. **Configuration Management**:
   - Defined `config/config.yaml` to manage paths and model parameters.

### Outcome
Clean and structured data ready for model training, with reproducible preprocessing steps.

## Phase 3: Model Development & Training

### Purpose
Build and train the forecasting model.

### Tasks
1. **Model Definition**:
   - Created `scripts/model.py` to define and train models.
   - Developed `notebooks/03_model_training.ipynb` for experimenting with different models.

2. **Model Storage**:
   - Saved baseline and trained models in `models/` directory.

3. **External Data**:
   - Stored external data in `data/external/` if required for enhancing model accuracy.

### Outcome
A set of trained models ready for evaluation, with the flexibility to incorporate external data.

## Phase 4: Model Evaluation & Visualization

### Purpose
Assess model performance and generate insights.

### Tasks
1. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Created `scripts/evaluation.py` to calculate performance metrics.
   - Developed `notebooks/04_model_evaluation.ipynb` to visualize results.

2. **Visualization**:
   - Implemented `scripts/visualization.py` for graphical analysis of model performance.

3. **Results Storage**:
   - Stored evaluation results in `models/model_evaluation.csv`.

### Outcome
A comprehensive evaluation of model performance, with visualizations to aid in understanding and presenting results.

## Phase 5: Testing & Documentation

### Purpose
Ensure project quality and maintainability.

### Tasks
1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Wrote unit tests for data processing, model training, and evaluation:
     - `tests/test_data_processing.py`
     - `tests/test_model.py`
     - `tests/test_evaluation.py`

2. **Documentation**:
   - Documented findings and insights in `reports/project_report.md`.
   - Prepared a presentation in `reports/presentation.pdf` to communicate results to stakeholders.

### Outcome
A robust and well-documented project with reliable code and clear communication of findings.

## Conclusion

By following these phases, the sales forecasting project ensures a structured approach to development, focusing on data processing and modeling first, followed by evaluation, testing, and documentation. This approach enhances project quality and maintainability, providing actionable insights for optimizing sales strategies.
