Here’s how you can prioritize and divide the **Sales Forecasting** project structure based on the order in which files should be created and coded:  

---

## **Phase 1: Initial Setup & Data Exploration (High Priority)**
### **Purpose:** Set up the environment, load data, and explore it.  
- Create `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` for package dependencies.  
- Initialize `README.md` to provide an overview.  
- Add `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files from version control.  
- Start **data exploration** in Jupyter:  
  - `notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb` (Load and analyze raw data).  
  - Create `data/raw/` and place sample datasets there.  

---

## **Phase 2: Data Preprocessing & Configuration**
### **Purpose:** Clean and process data for training.  
- Create `scripts/data_processing.py` to handle data cleaning.  
- Develop `notebooks/02_data_preprocessing.ipynb` to test and validate preprocessing steps.  
- Store processed data in `data/processed/`.  
- Define `config/config.yaml` to manage paths and model parameters.  

---

## **Phase 3: Model Development & Training**
### **Purpose:** Build and train the forecasting model.  
- Create `scripts/model.py` to define and train models.  
- Develop `notebooks/03_model_training.ipynb` for experimenting with different models.  
- Save baseline and trained models in `models/`.  
- Store external data in `data/external/` if required.  

---

## **Phase 4: Model Evaluation & Visualization**
### **Purpose:** Assess model performance and generate insights.  
- Create `scripts/evaluation.py` for performance metrics.  
- Develop `notebooks/04_model_evaluation.ipynb` to visualize results.  
- Implement `scripts/visualization.py` for graphical analysis.  
- Store results in `models/model_evaluation.csv`.  

---

## **Phase 5: Testing & Documentation**
### **Purpose:** Ensure project quality and maintainability.  
- Write unit tests:  
  - `tests/test_data_processing.py`  
  - `tests/test_model.py`  
  - `tests/test_evaluation.py`  
- Document findings:  
  - `reports/project_report.md`  
  - `reports/presentation.pdf`

This approach ensures that **data processing and modeling come first**, followed by evaluation, testing, and documentation. Let me know if you need adjustments! 🚀
